# South Korean Drama Recommendation System #

A recommendation system for South Korean dramas that suggests shows based on user preferences and viewing history. Users can discover new dramas and find hidden gems they might not have known about.

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Recommendation Algorithm**
The system uses a combination of content-based and collaborative filtering algorithms to recommend dramas to users. It analyzes the genre, tags, main actors, and user ratings to provide personalized recommendations.

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Single User Mode**
In this mode, users can explore recommendations tailored to their preferences. They can select a drama from the dropdown menu to view details and poster images.

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Multi User Mode**
Allows users to view recommendations for multiple users simultaneously, making it ideal for friends or family watching together. Each user gets personalized recommendations based on their viewing history.

‚ö° **Technologies**
- Python
- Streamlit
- BeautifulSoup
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn

üí° **Idea**
The idea behind this project was to create a user-friendly interface for discovering South Korean dramas. I wanted to combine the power of data analysis with user interaction to enhance the viewing experience.

ü§î **How Can It Be Improved?**
- Include more features for user interaction, such as a rating system or watchlist.
- Enhance the recommendation algorithm to consider more factors, such as seasonality or popularity trends.
- Improve the UI/UX design for a more engaging experience.

üêõ **Bug**
The system may encounter issues with certain dramas that have incomplete or missing information on the source website. Efforts are ongoing to address these issues and improve data quality.
